Modeling protein activity gradients in Yeast mating pathway
====================================
Yeast, or Saccharomyces cerevisia responds to mating pheromone with the help of a MAPK signaling cascade. On stimulation with pheromone this signaling pathway produces a gradient of protein activity eminating from the shmoo tip that guides the haploid cell through the mating process.

The goal of this project is to build a dynamic model capable of reproducing the observed activity gradient in the mating pathway of yeast [^1].

Preliminary results.
